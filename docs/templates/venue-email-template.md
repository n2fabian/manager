Subject: [BAND_NAME] - Booking Inquiry for [MONTH/YEAR]

Hey [VENUE_CONTACT_NAME],

Hope this email finds you well! 

I'm reaching out on behalf of [BAND_NAME], a [GENRE/STYLE] band from [LOCATION]. We're currently booking shows for [MONTH/YEAR] and would love to bring our live show to [VENUE_NAME].

[BAND_NAME] is [BRIEF_BAND_DESCRIPTION - 1-2 sentences about sound, vibe, and what makes the band unique].

We've been [RECENT_ACHIEVEMENT - e.g., "actively gigging in the region," "recently released our EP," "building a strong local following"], and we think our sound and energy would be a great fit for your venue.

Here's a bit about what we bring:
- [BAND_SIZE] piece band with professional live sound
- Draw of approximately [ESTIMATED_DRAW] people (can grow with promotion)
- Full backline [or specify what you bring/need]
- Professional attitude and easy to work with
- Active social media promotion for the show

We're flexible on dates and happy to work with your schedule. Our preferred dates are:
- [DATE_OPTION_1]
- [DATE_OPTION_2]
- [DATE_OPTION_3]

You can check us out here:
- Music: [STREAMING_LINK]
- Live video: [YOUTUBE_LINK]
- Instagram: [INSTAGRAM_HANDLE]

I've attached our tech rider for your reference. We're happy to discuss any questions or requirements you might have.

Looking forward to hearing from you and hopefully bringing some metal to [VENUE_NAME]!

Best regards,
