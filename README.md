## 🤘 The Metal Manager Philosophy

**Work hard. Play loud. Stay organized.**

Running a band is like drumming - it requires:
- **Timing**: Know when to push and when to wait
- **Rhythm**: Consistent effort beats sporadic hustle
- **Power**: Go all-in when it matters
- **Control**: Keep track of the details
- **Passion**: Never forget why you started

This system handles the boring stuff so you can focus on the music.
